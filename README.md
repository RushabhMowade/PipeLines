Here we have created simple pipelinses using the dataset Housing price prediction, which was publically available in kaggle. Here we used model like ridge (ensemble learning models can also be used) to predict the prices.

Model used : Regression Model (Ridge)

As this was a public competition, we had to submit it in a seprate csv file(named as submission).........
